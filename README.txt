# Network Check

This app will make sure the internet connection is up and running.

Once a minute it will try to connect to an external site and use led ring to signal problems. You can use the trigger from a flow to extend the signal function yourself.

Keep in mind that, once your internet connection is lost, some things like speech will not work properly all the time

Update:
SDK 2 introduced into app, rewrite for better compatibility
